CXY-MSv1 -- A corexy printer using Makerslide and a DuetWifi on 24vdc. Please ignore the messy wiring. :-)

https://youtu.be/llArYEVT2ow

9/18/16 - Changed to a double plate x-carriage, corexy-x-carriage.scad has mounts for BLTouch and dc42's ir sensor. Proximity sensor version is for 19mm diameter.
9/23/16 - Added photos of the rear of the x-carriage.
10/1/16 - Added mount for E3D's Titan Extruder with a E3DV6 hotend, posted stl has mounting for the ir bracket to use DC42's ir sensor. Proximity & BLTouch is available in the scad file.
10/15/16 - Updated blower.scad for the blower mounts for the Titan extruder mount.

All the horizontal 2020/2040, and the vertical & horizontal makerslide ends are tapped for 5mm.
Vertical 2020 is drilled with a 5.5mm bit for access to the screws that hold everything together. Four in the top and two in the bottom. Use drillguide.stl for drilling the holes.

Corexy-x-carriage-extruder-drillguide.stl has a drill guide if you want to use 1/8" Aluminum in place of the printed extruder plate.

Additional information can be found in the scad files. Include files are expected to be in a folder called inc in the folder with the printer's scad files.

Incomplete BOM for a printer that covers about x400 y400 z270:
2 650mm 2040 (front & rear) Can use makerslide
2 598mm Makerslide (y-axis - left and right)
1 631mm Makerslide (x-axis)
2 470mm Makerslide (z-axis)
4 550mm 2020 (for the four corners)
2 650mm 2020 (bottom front & rear)
2 598mm 2020 (bottom left & right)
2 580mm 2040 for a basic bed holder between z-axis plates
4 300mm 2020 for diagonal side supports
4 Makerslide carriage plates
14 Makerslide wheel kits
6 Eccentric spacers
5x30mm screws
5x35mm screws
24 M5x7mm screws (holds the extrusions together)
18 M5x6mm screws for the motor mounts & bearing brackets
2 M5x50 for front bearing brackets
4 M5x40mm for the corexy-xy.stls
M5 nuts
16 F625Z bearings & 12 5mm washers
4.8m GT2 belt
2 GT2 20 tooth pulleys
2 400mm TR8-8 leadscrews with flanged nut
For Z Axis belt drive, uses one stepper motor
1 1524mm GT2 closed loop belt
1 GT2 20 tooth pulley
2 GT2 40 tooth pulleys with 8mm hole for TR8 leadscrews
2 608 bearings
4 F625Z bearings
2 M3 set screws
2 M5x35mm screws
4 M5 washers
2 M5 nuts
In the top extrusions, I put 8 tnuts in each channel, the rest four in each. Use a short screw in a unused one to hold them to one side to quiet the rattle they can make while printing.

Spool holder: 300mm 2020 with two screw access holes in the bottom to mount it on the top rear 4020 and a 8mm hole in the top for a 8mm threaded rod long enough to hold a spool on each side. Using http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1647748 to hold the spools.

On the bearing brackets from the top: M5x50, bearing support, washer, 2xF625Z,2x washers,2x F625Z, M5 nut.

If you use metal couplers for the z-axis, use a 4mm ball bearing in between the TR8 and stepper motor shaft inside the coupler. The bearing will allow tilt without changing the length.

The Litemount.stl holds a 70mm LED ring in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8211 I used a LM2596 buck convertor to get the 12vdc to power the ring.

Alternate lighting method is to use a 5050 LED light string stuck to the bottom of the y axis makerslide.

Blower.scad uses http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:387301

The 400mm x 300mm 1/4" MIC-6 AL plate bed uses three short 2020 to support the bed, they're attached just like rest of the extrusions. I used three 45mm x 25mm x 9mm 6061 with a 5mm hole for the extrusion mount and tapped a 3mm hole to hold the bed. I uses some silicon tubing for the bed spacers. I used two keenovo 200x300 600w 110vac silicon heaters, using the thermistor in the center and wired the ac in parallel to a SSR. The printer uses 11.28 amps until PID kicks in, while printing it uses about 5 amps.

Fans are 24vdc 5015 blowers.

FancapL.stl is for the power supply fan to make it blow to the side.
